  <h2>ABOUT</h2>
  <h4>The Dumoine River in Western Quebec is one of the last free flowing, undammed, unsettled wild river tributaries left in the Ottawa River Watershed. This is unique, especially for a river that has had human habitation, exploration and exploitation for over a thousand years. The Quebec government protected the Dumoine River corridor as an Aquatic Reserve in 2009. Today for the first time in sixty years you can hike the lower Dumoine as well as canoe it.
 
    Today, sixty years later, a group of volunteers called Friends of Dumoine has cut open the entire tote road trail and established twenty wilderness campsites, many on the old river drive stopping places, to make the trail a wonderful hiking experience.
     
    Partners Wolf Lake First Nation, Zec Dumoine, Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society and Friends of Dumoine are working hard to research the history of the Dumoine Band Families, the ancient portages, the stopping places, the fire towers and shanty camps and the natural highlights of the trail to bring it all to life for you when you choose to visit the trail in person or virtually on this website.
    Please visit us often and support our work.
