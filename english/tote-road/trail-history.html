                  <p>
                    The Dumoine has been a trade route linking first nations people from the north and east with others coming from the south and west for centuries. 
                    The Ottawa River was the main trade route where they met sometimes at the mouth of the Dumoine other times at traditional meeting places further up or down the mighty Kichi Sipi. 
                    The Ottawa River watershed is the traditional home of the Algonquin Nation and the Dumoine was the traditional home of the Dumoine River Band of that nation. 
                    This band, a group of 12 families, created the first portages and hunting trails in the watershed.

                      <p>In the winter, teamsters, usually local farmers using their own horses and sleighs, would be paid by the pound to haul for loads of feed for the men and horses. 
                        They would “Tote” their loads into the camps. Hundreds of teams consisting of two horses and one man hauling 2000 pound loads would travel up the tote road many times each winter. 
                        Their travel limit per day was about 12 miles so crude homesteads with extra stables and bunkhouses were established to shelter the men and horses, 
                        by the lumber companies or entrepreneurial families, at this distance.</p>

                      <p>On the Dumoine Tote road the Dufoe family was at the beginning, at the mouth of the Dumoine, then the Bertrand Family was at the junction of the Dumoine and Fildegrande Rivers where the road split. 
                        Another 8 miles up the Dumoine was the Potvin family stopping place, and 8 miles up the Fildegrande was a logging company stopping place at Dixon Lake called ‘Halfway’. 
                        There was a company stopping place at Robinson Lake four miles from the Potvin’s and another at Rowanton, 10 miles from Robinson Lake, above Grande Chute.

                      <p>The river drives would take advantage of the portages and camps created by the Dumoine Band on their annual spring running of the logs. 
                        The longest timber slide in Eastern Canada was built to safely transport the logs around the spectacularly ferocious Grande Chute.</p>

                    <p>Timber slides and Lumberjacks</p>
                  </header>
                  <p>Throughout the four centuries since 1600, European traders, priests, lumbermen, settlers, forest rangers and sportsmen adopted these trails for their own purposes. 
                    The lumber trade, which began cutting the big pines of the Dumoine in the 1830s, was dependent on huge amounts of supplies 
                    (estimated at three pounds for every board foot cut) to run their winter cutting operations.</p>
                  <p>To accomplish this they built a road, suitable for horse-drawn sleighs and wagons, from the mouth of the Dumoine to the shanty camps along the Dumoine and Fildegrande Rivers. 
                    The cut logs were moved by the floodwaters of the spring on annual river drives, so all the shanties were close to water flowing into these two rivers.</p>

                    <h3><a href="#">Fire Fighting</a></h3>
                    <p>Rangers and Forest Fires</p>
                  </header>
                  <p>In the 1900s the forest was patrolled by forest rangers watching for fires from a series of fire towers throughout the Dumoine Valley. 
                  The Tote road became the access route for these rangers and their fire fighting equipment. 
                  Lastly, a new breed of urban sportsmen, keen on the Dumoine hunting and fishing experience, walked up the Dumoine Tote Road to their cabins beginning in 1918.</p>
                  <p>By 1960 air patrols by float planes were used to locate fires. Improved trucks and bush roads all replaced the forest rangers, the river drives and offered an alternative for the walk-in sportsmen. 
                    The Tote Road was then abandoned to nature.</p>
